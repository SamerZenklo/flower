          <strong> The Gold Coast</strong> is one of several "Coast" regions
          found in Florida, including the Space Coast, Treasure Coast, the Sun
          Coast and the First Coast. Like several of the others, it seems to
          have originated at the time the area first saw major growth.

          <img src="img/coast5.jpg" alt="No photo" />[1] It was well established at the time
          of a 1982 survey of Florida's vernacular regions by Ary J. Lamme and
          Raymond K. Oldakowski, who indicate that the name denoted "the high
          cost of living in these areas, as well as the supposedly glittering
          lifestyle".[2] At that time, survey respondents from Dade County (now
          Miami-Dade) in the south, through Broward and Palm Beach Counties and
          into Martin County in the north, identified their area as the Gold
          Coast.[2] A 2007 survey by the same authors found that the Gold Coast
          was still one of the best known of all of Florida's regions across the
          state, but that it was then restricted primarily to Miami-Dade and
          Broward Counties, corresponding to the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area.
          People from Palm Beach and Martin Counties chiefly identified their
          areas as part of a new region, the Treasure Coast, which also included
          St. Lucie and Indian River Counties. Lamme and Oldakowski note that
          Palm Beach County remained part of South Florida and the Miami
          metropolitan area. They suggest that negative connotations that had
          developed for the Gold Coast and a desire to distinguish the area
          conceptually from Miami may have led to the emergence of the Treasure
          Coast.[2]

          From one-of-a-kind attractions to unforgettable adventures, Florida’s
          Paradise Coast – including Naples, Marco Island and the Everglades –
          makes family time the best time ever. Go on a dolphin-sighting (and
          learning) expedition, joining up with a survey crew for an eco-tour
          like no other. Venture into Everglades National Park, the only
          subtropical preserve in North America and part of the country’s
          largest wetlands ecosystem. Join a boat tour at the Gulf Coast Visitor
          Center in Everglades City and explore the saltwater mangrove estuary
          portion of the park, where you'll spot bottlenose dolphins and
          numerous bird species.
