        The Gold Coast is a region of the U.S. state of Florida. It is located
        on the Atlantic coast of South Florida

        <strong> The Gold Coast</strong> is one of several "Coast" regions found
        in Florida, including the Space Coast, Treasure Coast, the Sun Coast and
        the First Coast. Like several of the others, it seems to have originated
        at the time the area first saw major growth.[1] It was well established
        at the time of a 1982 survey of Florida's vernacular regions by Ary J.
        Lamme and Raymond K. Oldakowski, who indicate that the name denoted "the
        high cost of living in these areas, as well as the supposedly glittering
        lifestyle".[2] At that time, survey respondents from Dade County (now
        Miami-Dade) in the south, through Broward and Palm Beach Counties and
        into Martin County in the north, identified their area as the Gold
        Coast.[2] A 2007 survey by the same authors found that the Gold Coast
        was still one of the best known of all of Florida's regions across the
        state, but that it was then restricted primarily to Miami-Dade and
        Broward Counties, corresponding to the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area. People
        from Palm Beach and Martin Counties chiefly identified their areas as
        part of a new region, the Treasure Coast, which also included St. Lucie
        and Indian River Counties. Lamme and Oldakowski note that Palm Beach
        County remained part of South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area.
        They suggest that negative connotations that had developed for the Gold
        Coast and a desire to distinguish the area conceptually from Miami may
        have led to the emergence of the Treasure Coast.[2]

        From one-of-a-kind attractions to unforgettable adventures, Florida’s
        Paradise Coast – including Naples, Marco Island and the Everglades –
        makes family time the best time ever. Go on a dolphin-sighting (and
        learning) expedition, joining up with a survey crew for an eco-tour like
        no other. Venture into Everglades National Park, the only subtropical
        preserve in North America and part of the country’s largest wetlands
        ecosystem. Join a boat tour at the Gulf Coast Visitor Center in
        Everglades City and explore the saltwater mangrove estuary portion of
        the park, where you'll spot bottlenose dolphins and numerous bird
        species.
